Blurry Screen

- working blur application for Mac OS X so far
- written in Objective-C with Cocoa-API
- makes use of the CoreGraphics framework to directly access low-level graphics interfaces
- menubar-application without existence in system tray
- interface to a second, platform independent application will control the blurring
- a version for linux and/or windows will be developed if there is enough time
