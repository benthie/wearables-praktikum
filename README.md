# wearables-praktikum

<b>EyeDrops</b><br>
<i>a project by Marlene Fiedler, Lorenz Miething and Benjamin Thiemann</i>

In the context of the Embedded Systems Lab "Wearables" we were asked to build our own wearable device. Our idea since then is to build a blinking detection system, that recognizes the user's lack of blinking when e.g. sitting in front of the computer screen. With a custom-built software the user of our device will be stimulated to blink without even noticing that he has been done so.
