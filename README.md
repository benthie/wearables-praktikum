# wearables-praktikum

<b>EyeDrops</b><br>
<i>a project by Marlene Fiedler, Lorenz Miething and Benjamin Thiemann</i>

In the context of the Embedded Systems Lab "Wearables", which started at the end of Oct 2016, we were asked to build our own wearable device. Our idea since then is to build a blinking detection system that recognizes the user's lack of blinking when e.g. sitting in front of the computer screen. With a custom-built software the user of our device will be stimulated to blink without even noticing that he has been doing so.
